=Sphinx Client API 0.9.9-dev (r1299)

This document gives an overview of what is Sphinx itself and how to use in 
within Ruby on Rails. For more information or documentation, 
please go to http://www.sphinxsearch.com

==Sphinx

Sphinx is a standalone full-text search engine, meant to provide fast, 
size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other applications. 
Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with SQL databases and 
scripting languages. Currently built-in data sources support fetching data 
either via direct connection to MySQL, or from an XML pipe.
 
Simplest way to communicate with Sphinx is to use <tt>searchd</tt> -
a daemon to search through fulltext indices from external software.
